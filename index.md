# Planetary Data Sciences Update : : : M_R_O
### August 1, 2024. The SHARAD radargrams from the SHARAD Science Team have been migrated to the PDS4 standard. See the PDS4 notes document for details.

The PDS Geosciences Node Spectral Library is a database of laboratory spectra submitted by various data providers. It includes spectra from the Reflectance Experiment Laboratory (RELAB) at Brown University as well as XAS and reflectance spectra from the [PDS4 bundles below](https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/spectrallibrary/default.htm)... ~>

![EcoStress](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/logo.png)

### Dear Rep/Mayor Karen,
I signed up for a class that [NASAJPL](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/events/ecostress-science-and-application-team-meeting-fall-2024) is offering at [CourtYard by Marriot Pasadena](https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/courtyard-los-angeles-pasadena-monrovia.html). As you can see in the [LAPD DETAinMENT on METROLA PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricoThaka/ricothaka.github.io/pixelsquare/assets/pdf/image.pdf), I was accused of Tresspassing. I i dont know what i need to do to use the transit system safely. LAPD is pushing [FareEnforcement](https://abc7.com/post/metro-safety-stopping-fare-evaders-seen-key-preventing-crime/15054806/) but are not making exceptions. If you look at the graphic below in my [GMAiL_EMAiL_iNBOX](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXd4idMbwAUqOMQ?format=jpg&name=large) you will see that Los Angeles Police never emailed me back after i was victim of that Armed Gunman at CityHAll with the Playboy Backpack on, so this Tap card thing. I see people at Saint Francis with MailBoxes and There is this place in Santa Monica that offer mailboxes, but im in a different situation since i was Abandoned. I took a shower at [Reality_LA](https://realityla.com/), AND I KNOW The Medicated Shampoo and Terry Cloth towel Pulled out at least 200 bugs! The Larve breask my hair down and it just cracks off while Dry Scapl tortures me with itching and burning. Please send a team from NasaJPL to talk to them about what [Entomological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_warfare#:~:text=EW%20is%20a%20specific%20type,the%20insects%20over%20target%20areas.) looks like in [Los Angeles ](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA530979.pdf).

So I want to make sure i can make the [ECOSTRESS Science and Application Team Meeting - Fall 2024](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/events/ecostress-science-and-application-team-meeting-fall-2024) meeting and start making more progress on getting my badge back. Whereever my daughter is, Erika, and the dancing girls... Id dont matter! I have to be badged. [A California driver’s license](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/driver-licenses-dl/) used to be easy to renew. People will not call nasajpl and they look criminal all through los angeles. One of those briefcase Cellphone providers i tried made me scared bc the calls to the front desk are routed to a Hollywood Action Movie actor who was lying to me about important processes there. [HollywoodFoodCo](https://hofoco.org/) have raffles fo id_vouchers. They have no idea how silly they look every single time i get that mediocre ass food! dead bird etc no rice...  <a href="https://ricothaka.github.io/worknotes03/#urbanheat">Click here</a> to see NASAJPL coverage of the LosangelesHeat wave and its a conversation that connects to P{Hytoplankton}, Chemical Lacerations, and unwanted amputations implemented on "[The Homeless](https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2024-09-13/los-angeles-homeless-proposal-20-billion)"

[Among the Peaks of Hale Crater](https://www.uahirise.org/hipod/ESP_075380_1440)
This observation was requested as part of a new monitoring sequence, to try to get activity after a dust storm to compare with a previous sequence. Are the recurring slope lineae longer or more dense? Hale was created by an impactor roughly 35 kilometers (22 mi) across that impacted at an oblique angle about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.

## Twin of NASA’s Perseverance Mars Rover Begins Terrain Tests

![Optimism](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipia24525-e1-1041.jpg)

Jamie, I am getting confused. The person that put me down is a firefighter too and put me down there. Is there like some sort of equipment Flow Control? Bc [Optimism](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/jpl/twin-of-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover-begins-terrain-tests/)... I cant remember but I know He is going to talk to me soon, and I need to be ready Ms Bass! 
`Updated with new features, including additional mobility software and the bulk of the sample caching system, the twin of NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover arrives at JPL’s Mars Yard garage on Oct. 29, 2021. Called OPTIMISM, the vehicle is used for testing commands before they are sent to Mars.`


## Code Refactoring
Good Afternoon MRO. 
Dear Chris, i know you were a Mori Person as well but older and i was brought on like TekSystems so i was mision right away. I remember ppl were talking about using Salt for configuration Management and there is the inhouse system. I mean it all seems attached to the Netapp and that Refurb that happened in the Mission Control Datacenter. I was Told there was cracks in the floor and i thought you all were Mean military people. I was in my head lashing out at my marriage and religious way of life collapsing and worried aobut being chased off. Thanks. BTW i did not recall the rover is Nuclear Powered!

I really enjoyed this section from [Steve Lindstorm](https://dontpaniclabs.com/blog/post/2020/11/11/reflections-on-css-refactoring-by-steve-lindstrom/)

Now i dont know what standards exist if any but this is the type of information i shared with the girls my age from Dance411. The problem is they was teaching a lot of criiminal men and they infiltrated corporate and really hurt atlanta. I was talking to her independantyly and teaching her middleware bc thats where she was getting knixed online. The thing is with the Striptease they have to balance functioning in the daytime affter a nighttime kidnapping and rape. Im not saying every guy that has been in her company is bad. But she has been asking me for a child for about 5 years now. Im afraid and bleeding.

# Cydonia to Watts?
Dear Nicky,

I skipped ahead... I was sitting in [Saint_Francis](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GWU8mdlbQAUEeSF?format=png&name=4096x4096) and i felt insecure, u know people are funny about Mars Research, The Metaphysics have abused ppl sexualy for years. I love how the images remove the fear that i am being strange. So [The Draw Of Cydonia](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Cydonia_s_Face_on_Mars_in_3D_animation) you describe the [Design of the Tesla Coil ](https://www.teslacoildesign.com/), well not  the [design](https://archive.org/details/Giant_Robot_Volume_1_The_Night_the_Earth_Stood_Still), but you mention [Wardenclyff Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower) which look like [Dalek](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/doctor-who-aliens/) kinda... i might be [looking up the wrong thing](https://archive.org/details/giant-robo-collection-1) but the structure is reminicent of the [Watts Towers in Los Angeles County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Towers) `33°56′19.46″N 118°14′27.77″W` While iot may be my DNS everything i find about them is that its an Art installations... `"Wireless Radio Station"` thats what got my attention! I have been getting online relationships organized and [Normani](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/dsn) is learning about the Facility. I have to get her clean from all that fraud working at [MagicCity](https://youtu.be/0dtGIjbe0r0?si=W5ESksjUFE63jQ2U) that place is such a burden. Anyway since u mention  [Wardenclyff Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIR7tcS5d8A) I want to talk to someone at work but they dont know alot but everything. I hate that they use vendor supplies, we should be all solaris if we wanna mason that shit, freebsd if we wanna tribal that shit
## this is an old post
I was at [Griffith](https://griffithobservatory.org/about/observatory-history/) and took some video Flikr Tourist style with my peice of shit ObamaPhone but the shits work, maybe watts towers was delivering wireless energy! Ile Los Angeles `Electric Avenue` has deeper meaning than we think.

## [HiView Image Viewer - Software](https://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/software/HiView/download.php)

### WHAT HiView DOES
HiView is a data explorer and image viewing application supporting the [JPEG2000](https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/) image format ![HiVeiw](https://www.uahirise.org/hiview/images/main-splash-screen.jpg) HiView is the best way to explore HiRISE images of the Martian surface at the full resolution of the imagery. Tracks of boulders that have fallen down crater walls, delicate rays of ejecta from fresh impact craters, and the unearthly formations created by carbon dioxide ice on the Martian south pole are just a few of the things that are waiting to be discovered by anyone using a tool like HiView with HiRISE imagery.

Dear_KevinRothwell idk whats going on with my life but im living in Los Angeles right now. You fired me. Do you have ties to [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117803?) because [Raising Dion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_Dion) is an embellished copy of my life with Coral! Theres a Gender swap. And she is a graphic designer, those girls from Dance411 know me that way i was hired as an inter webdeveloper probono an its like Willow Smith or Chloe Bailey from Rentpath Graphic Design... Well maybe thats not you [yallywood](https://www.wsj.com/story/welcome-to-yallywood-atlanta-is-now-the-hot-spot-for-celebrity-home-buyers-aa98768b).

Jeff told me he worked for JPL in the past so I thoughtI was in the right place. Ashley is related to you one way or another. There aer images posted from Curiosity and I was doing research my blog is popular back east and so is CNN. I was doing Geology on Mars and all the places [I need to explore  ](https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/) are on that map so its not like she stole something i cooked from scratch and im new to the world of research. So to be honest im confused. But Nakesha held me down for sex and i was all ready digging her so its toxic but not in terms of her control over my physical being and mind... She works at Magic City an they out here in Losangeles dancing at a the place from [Demi Moore movie  sHOWGIRLS](https://archive.org/details/showgirls-tv-version) I yelled at you to get away from me bc u dont realize you not my daddy, that was nasty an Mike Child a villian in the AJC...

## "Martian" meteorites SNC and others
# [The ALH 84001 Controversy ](https://astronomyonline.org/Astrobiology/ALH84001.asp)


The SNC-meteorites are a group of Achondrite meteorites, by them is assumed, that they originate from the Mars.
Shergottite meteorites are often made of mineral grains that can't be seen clearly without a microscope. The brown areas are grains of the mineral pyroxene and the clear white areas are the mineral plagioclase. These are the two most abundant minerals in a mafic magma of the Earth...[ReadMore](https://www.b14643.de/SNC-Meteorites/) [LEW88516 – 13.2 grams Lherzolitic Shergottite](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/mmc/lew88516.pdf)

### MARS METEORITE ALH 84001
Date: 05 April 2001
Copyright: NASA/JSC

This Martian meteorite is thought by some scientists to contain evidence of life on Mars. The rock is designated ALH84001, after the Allan Hills in Antarctica where it was found. [EuropeanSpaceAgency](https://sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/26756-mars-meteorite-alh-84001)

### Terrestrial Age
The “terrestrial age” of a meteorite is how long ago the meteorite fell to Earth. If people witnessed the meteorite’s fall, then its terrestrial age is obvious. But most meteorites, and all Antarctic meteorites like ALH 84001, fell without being noticed by people. Fortunately, terrestrial ages of meteorites can also be calculated from the abundances of some naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of chemical elements. These radioactive isotopes are formed in a meteorite, in space, as it is bombarded by cosmic rays (high-energy elementary particles). After a meteorite lands on Earth, it isn’t hit by cosmic rays any more, no more of the radioactive isotopes form, and the ones already in the rock continue decaying away. So, the more of these isotopes in a meteorite, the less time it has spent on Earth. Terrestrial ages are usually determined from isotopes of the elements carbon (14C), beryllium (10Be), and chlorine (36Cl).

The best measure of ALH 84001’s terrestrial age comes from its abundance of carbon-14 (14C). Carbon-14 dating is most commonly used to get ages for things like archaeological artifacts and the Shroud of Turin. The abundance of carbon-14 in ALH 84001 gives a terrestrial age of about 13,000 years [(Jull et al., 1995)](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/meteorites/ALH84001_References.html#JUL95).

![ALH84001](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/meteorites/metonice.gif)
The National Science Foundation (U.S.) sponsors meteorite-collecting expeditions to Antarctica nearly every year. Meteorites are not abundant anywhere on Earth, but are easier to find in Antarctica than elsewhere on Earth. It’s easy to see black meteorites on the white ice. Also, meteorites that fall onto the Antarctic ice are frozen and preserved much better than they would be anywhere else on Earth. Photo c/o Ursula Marvin, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. ALH 84001 was found in Antarctica during the 1984-1985 Antarctic summer. It was found by a team of meteorite hunters from the ANSMET program, which is sponsored by the Polar Programs Office of the U.S. National Science Foundation. ANSMET stands for ANtarctic Search for METeorites, and has been funded since 1977 by the NSF. In that time, ANSMET meteorite hunters have found more than 7000 meteorites, almost triple the number known from outside Antarctica. The Antarctic Meteorite Location and Mapping Project (AMLAMP) provides locations, maps, and databases of meteorite finds.

### Fossil Life in ALH 84001?
>These pages are an explanation of the Science paper of Dr. David McKay and his co-workers, where they give evidence that martian bacteria may have lived in the martian meteorite ALH 84001. I’ve tried to organize and review their evidence that ALH 84001 contains fossils and traces of ancient martian life, and also tried to outline some counter-evidence and some likely questions about the evidence. My intention is to present the work of McKay and co-authors even-handedly and nonjudgmentally.

### <a id="Mori">It Involves Mori</a> 
### [Dear_Jamie](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/)
While i was in atlanta A childhood sweetheart walked backinto my life. She did not tell me she was a sex slave. Alot of what I hear in the [Immigration Reform](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/topics/immigration-reform) headlines and [topics](https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/1200) (S.1200 - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986) would protect her from being sold on the street. But im wondering about how I can stay safe. Theres about 7 women all my age possibly 9 bc they have disquses like [Sartu](https://x.com/sartuadem) is also [Normani The Popstar](https://people.com/normani-calls-boyfriend-dk-metcalf-an-answered-prayer-8658837) so Get this! Erika has a deep history in East Los Angeles. I found a documenary on [Vicky's Town Chronicles](https://www.youtube.com/@VickysTownChronicles) called [Gangster Girls 1999 East LA](https://youtu.be/CIRxStt5jqI?si=SYGl2AUtd1DIZxzx) so she hid that from me, she was stalking me on [OkayPlayer](https://www.okayplayer.com/new-summer-albums-june) and [12ozProphet](https://forum.12ozprophet.com/forum/6-brick-slayers/) and those were not secret but segmented lives when I was a JehovahsWitness! So The confusion i have is that [Prostitution is illegal here!](https://www.keglawyers.com/prostitution-and-solicitation-penal-code-647b#:~:text=California%20Penal%20Code%20647). I never told you but a big part of the black community dont like me working here... I have been tortured and sabotaged eversince month 2 of my employment post [Mori Associates](https://moriassociates.com/) [Mori on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mori-associates) and when [Jose Pi](https://community.pmi.org/profile/josempi#_=_) <a href="https://static.projectmanagement.com/images/profile-photos/46666245_120718014114_p.jpg"><img src="https://static.projectmanagement.com/images/profile-photos/46666245_120718014114_p.jpg" style="width:180px;height:252px;margin-right:5px;padding:10px;" align="left" alt="Pineapple" /> </a> told me i could not come back, i was coming in later than 8am bc i was troubleshooting [AirQuality](https://eospso.nasa.gov/earth-observer-archive) which is normal when your wife is having seizurs and your 3 year old is waking up in pools of blood!~ like it was serious! So now i understand that for the Pornography mob to take a family they havce to disable the breadwinner. Erika suggested we live outside, but that was a set up to dump me and i held on to the child as long as possible taking remote, devops and any position that would get me to the next meal with the kid and whatever i needed to keep her mother from running out in front of a car (YuppieSex). So The brown girl in the photo looks like #Muna_Ahmed from atlanta it could be Normani but we had a serious sexual relationship in georgia and she wanted to grow with a stable partner. And Coral was not a blacck Eye for a relationship bc She was happy and had dreadlocks the brown girls were from Africa so they loved me as a father and wanted to have a baby and We just continue. Then Muna died and Normani stepped in as Sartu at Muna funeral. I ended up back in California after someone saw Normani or Muna leave my East Atlanta Cottage (631 moreland ave) my life fell apart. Dwayne_Gooden of IonicSecurity and [USMC](https://www.marines.mil/) Started bullying me and saying Ethiopian girls are hard to get. He brought me in his office to talk about nightlife an i was questioned on "fuckinBitchiz" its a foriegn concept bc those prostitutes aka groupies are like stage children in regular population and being a JehovahsWitness stage child im a quick go to after they done murdered some pimp or something! And I want a peacful life. The guys that buy them for sex often molest children or turn a blind eye to it, so what do I do? i never bought anyone for sex or raped or even took advantage of anyone, maybe erika a little bit bc deepdown i knew we were just friends... But about the amout of women, they always comhome after they get a free break [MagicCity](https://www.magiccity.com/) dont talk about what they do to local men to perform... its dark, i want to work and earn money please help me

Hi Jamie/Robin/Brenda
  During my last time with you on campus i was told to explore the wheels! I guess you guys Saw my research to build a high powered grocery getter. I found this hole in the wheel about two months ago. The girls are really going through it right now and I really dont know what the future holds, but im dedicated to the mission. Jose Pi did not know i was real. I slap myself for running off when he said you cant come back. I learned a lot about working remote in Atlanta but i got fired twice bc i was having too much fun! I was completing tasks and training thier employees! PearsonEdu had a bunch of Windows admins and i tought them a lot of LinuxBased #DNS philosophy next thing you know im working remote and i have no income! If you are not in a office position ppl stop trusting you. I never knew my coworkeds went to MagicCity its a dark neighborhood secret and as we got older i aged out of the computer world in the east bc Normani got famous in BallroomDanceing and numbed the sex servant side to the eyes of the Public. Once i was seen with her it got really hard at work, I had no idea so much sabotage exisited. We got involved also be i was working 24.7 oncall "MissionCritical" support for Web.com and Ionic Security i saved them from Splunk issues so many times at night. I understand sleepcycles bc she became my friend. Im OnCall for them so "Be oncall for me" It was a freindship gesture. Now im friends with a sex slave, thats attracted to me!

<p>This image, taken in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's High Bay 1 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on July 23, 2019, shows a close-up of the head of Mars 2020's remote sensing mast. The mast head contains the SuperCam instrument (its lens is in the large circular opening). In the gray boxes beneath mast head are the two Mastcam-Z imagers. On the exterior sides of those imagers are the rover's two navigation cameras.

I have not really connected to any of your songs before, but today is different. I miss riding in [Savannah](https://visitsavannah.com/). I lost my little girl, the one that was with me when you an your girl pulled up on me in Savannah. That song was really healing. Im in Los Angeles, i got intimate with [Normani](https://variety.com/2024/music/news/normani-dopamine-debut-solo-album-1235918512/) and i dont know what life is, but i saw that LenoxMall tape when [Allied](https://www.aus.com/) tried you. They had this Intership program at Dance411 an a few girls encircled me, we went to Graveyard and HodgePodge for meetings, an after some reondevus with about 4 different girls that all wear the same makeup i realized i got played... There is this lightskinone i see in Hollywood hellafly, used to dance there... Anyway Im running bc i was accused of killing erika and ppl trying to kill me bc the charge cant stick! [Nasa](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) has been monitoring me an i know i can get clear! If you stuck in LosAngeles go get a BackgroundCheck its [FortMcFphereson](https://militarybases.com/georgia/fort-mcpherson/) for LA bc im getting taht since im criminally clean they putting a lot of pressure on me to stay healthy so they can come home. Erika is [Latto](https://www.essence.com/celebrity/mulatto-rapper/) her an Gucci was ... actually u know all there was a [namechange](https://www.11alive.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/the-a-scene/why-rapper-mulatto-changed-her-name/85-2e9c3a1c-0d0f-4ea3-9589-91ded4a60165) an im hurt but since Matt is involved i hope there was like a bad trick bc, at somepoint hey will be free from Playboy an im grieving Normani getting shit Erika missed out on bc they would never give her privacy as a married woman.
